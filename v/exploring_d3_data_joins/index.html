<h3>Exploring selections and data binding in d3 (Part I)</h3> 

<h4>Intro</h4> 

<p> 
This is an ongoing article where I explore a core functionality provided by 
d3: selections and data binding. Why? I realized I didn't fully understand how it
works and that was limiting the benefit I get from the library. 
This is more to clarify my thoughts about the topic.
</p>

Let's start with the basics:

<pre>
<code class="javascript">const sel = select('body')
    .selectAll('h2');</code></pre>

<p> 
The first part of the statement (<code>select('body')</code>) uses the select
method from d3-selection package. This will return a new selection which is a
javascript function (remember they are also objects) with all the selection 
functionality attached to it. By functionality I mean a bunch of functions attached
to this object. Exploring the selection object returned is informative.
</p>

<h4>Exploring selections and data binding in d3 (Part I)</h4> 

<p> It is important to stop here for a second and review what constructs <a
href="https://bost.ocks.org/mike/">Mike</a> is using to provide this
functionality. He has a wonderful <a
href="https://bost.ocks.org/mike/chart/">article</a> that covers this. I am
going to go over it with my own words.  </p>

<p> He uses a "configurable" function that returns another function. The inner
function has access to all the config parameters we pass to the configurable
function (via a <a href="http://jibbering.com/faq/notes/closures/">closure</a>).
This function he returns, has functionality attached (setter/getter methods).
Each of those "methods" return the function itself. Thanks to that we can
chain calls together. 

<p>Let's build a simple example that encapsulates the logic to add two numbers to
solidify these concepts. 

<pre>
<code class="javascript">function calculator(opts={}) {
  let {x = 0, y = 0} = opts;

  function engine() {
    return x+y;
  }

  engine.x = function (value) {
    if (!arguments.length) return x;
    x = value;
    return engine;
  }

  engine.y = function (value) {
    if (!arguments.length) return y;
    y = value;
    return engine;
  }

  return engine;
}</code></pre>

<p> Let's use that new piece of code we have just created. First, we call our new functions
and provide the two numbers we want to add: <code>c = calculator({x:1, y:2}).</code> When we 
execute the function, we assign the x and y values from the opts parameter (an object) to 
the local variables x and y. After that, we create a function (<code>engine</code>) that
encapsulates the logic we need (adding two numbers in this case). Then, we attach two setter
and getter functions (methods) to our engine function. This logic checks for the input
parameter (a number) and either sets a new value o returns the addend (x or y). In both cases, 
we return the engine function. Because of that, we can do things like:
</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">c.x(100).y(200)() // 300</code></pre>

<h4>Data binding</h4>

<p>Excellent. We are ready to move on. Let's bring back the original d3 statement:</p>


<pre>
<code class="javascript">const sel = select('body')
    .selectAll('h2');</code></pre>

<p>
We are chaining another select call (<code>.selectAll('h2')</code>) but at this 
stage, we have already narrowed down the "selection space" to children of the body
element. That's because we are running the selection off of the first selection
result (a selection object).
</p>

<p>
Now that we have selected the elements we are interested on, we can go ahead and
preform data binding. That's linking our data to the elements we have selected.
We do it by using the property <code>data</code> from our selection object.
</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">const sel = select('body')
    .selectAll('h2')
    .data(data);</code></pre>

<p> <code>data</code> is an array of values. Those values will be assigned to
the selected elements. But, what happens if we have missing elements? Or what
happens if we have more elements than elements in our data array? The data
method in our selection returns an object that knows how to deal with that. It
does so by providing methods (operations) on these different cases.
<code>data()</code> returns the elements that exist and are linked to our
dataset. That's called the update selection. We can access the other selections
via <code>enter()</code> and <code>exit()</code>.
<code>enter()</code> gives us access to elements that do not exist yet but for
which we have data and <code>exit()</code> yields elements without data associated
to it. Let's write some code to exercise these concepts.</p>

<p>This is a helper function that executes the data binding and exercises
the enter, update, and remove() states:</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">function basicDataJoin(selector, data) {
  const sel = select(selector)
    .selectAll('span')
    .data(data);

  sel.text(d => d)
    .attr('class', 'update');

  sel.enter()
    .append('span')
    .text(d => d)
      .attr('class', 'enter');

  sel.exit().remove();
}</code></pre>

<p>Now, let's run <code>  basicDataJoin('#numbers_example_1', ['a', 'b',
'c']);</code>.  New elements have the <span style="color:salmon">salmon
color</span> and new  elements use <span style="color:darkred">dark red</span>.
</p>

<div id="numbers_example_1" class="numbers"></div>

<p>Excellent, all our new elements are there and they are properly bind to our data. Let's
now call the same function twice so we exercise the enter and remove states:<p>

<pre><code class="javascript">basicDataJoin('#numbers_example_2', ['a', 'b', 'c']);
basicDataJoin('#numbers_example_2', ['a', 'x', 'y']);</code></pre>

<p>And we get:</p>

<div id="numbers_example_2" class="numbers"></div>

<p> That may look strange to you. It seems those are existing letters/data?
What is happening here is that the first element is assigned to the first
datum, the second element to the second datum and so on. We are <a
href="https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/README.md#joining-data">joining
by index</a>.  But d3 provides alternatives to perform this binding. We can
provide a function that evaluates on each element we select. The value
returned by that function is what we will use to join the elements and datums.
Let's write another helper function: </p>

<pre><code class="javascript">function advanceDataJoin(selector, data) {
  const f = (d) => d.letter;
  const sel = select(selector).selectAll('span').data(data, f);

  sel.text(f)
    .attr('class', 'update');

  sel.enter()
    .append('span')
    .text(f)
    .attr('class', 'enter');

  sel.exit().remove();
}</code></pre>

<p>Let's run that now like this:</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">advanceDataJoin('#numbers_example_3', [ {letter: 'a'}, {letter:'b'} ]);
advanceDataJoin('#numbers_example_3', [ 
  {letter:'b'}, {letter: 'c'} 
]);</code></pre>

<p>
And that's what we wanted. Now, after the second call, a is gone b
is part of the update selection and c is part of the enter selection.
</p>

<div id="numbers_example_3" class="numbers"></div>

<script type="text/javascript" src="app.bundle.js"></script></body>
