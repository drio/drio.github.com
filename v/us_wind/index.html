		<p> This is a visualization for the dataset from this <a href="https://data.world/makeovermonday/2019w8">make over monday</a> challenge. It is data related to the amount of power generated using wind technology by the different US states.
		</p>
		<p> I added some extra data to see how the population and area of a state change with the other variables provided in the challenge.
		</p>
		<p> I find the parallel plot very effective to explain this dataset. Thank you to the developers of <a href="https://github.com/syntagmatic/parallel-coordinates">d3.parcoords.js</a>. Thanks to them, I didn't have to code this visualization from scratch. You guys did a great job with the API also.
		</p>
		<p>This viz was also a good opportunity to explor brushing and zooming. Two interaction techniques I believe work well in this context. Feel free to zoom in the dotplots and brush along the axis in the parallel plot.</p>
